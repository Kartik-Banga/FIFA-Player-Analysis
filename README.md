FIFA PLAYER ANALYSIS - 

The FIFA Player Analysis project employed robust data cleaning processes utilizing Python programming. The initial phase involved checking for null values, validating data types, and ensuring uniqueness in key columns like 'ID,' 'Name,' and 'LongName.' The removal of duplicates in 'Name' and 'LongName' was executed to eliminate potential confusion during subsequent analyses. The Python programming language, along with its Pandas library, was pivotal in executing these data cleaning tasks efficiently and programmatically.

Further cleaning processes involved handling the 'Contract' column by splitting it into 'Contract start year' and 'Contract end year' using the '~' delimiter. Python's string manipulation capabilities were harnessed to convert entries in the 'height' and 'weight' columns into a unified format. The cleaning of 'value,' 'wage,' and 'Release Clause' columns also relied on Python, employing string manipulation techniques to ensure uniformity and consistency in representing financial figures. These processes collectively enhanced the dataset's integrity and prepared it for subsequent analytical insights.

The analytics phase involved a combination of Python for data manipulation and analysis, along with visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representations. Exploring player performance by age group leveraged Python's Pandas library for creating age categories and computing average overall ratings (OVA). The correlation analysis between contract length and market value was conducted using Python's NumPy library to calculate correlation coefficients.

Positional analysis, undervaluation investigations, and exploration of contract dynamics based on age and potential (POT) ratings utilized Python's Pandas library for data manipulation and filtering. Matplotlib and Seaborn were employed for creating visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to present the findings in a visually compelling manner. The identification of attribute combinations correlated with a player's overall rating (OVA) involved Python's statistical analysis capabilities, exploring relationships within the dataset.
